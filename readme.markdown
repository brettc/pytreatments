# pytreatments: A simple experimental simulation framework

I use this framework to aid in running a simulation like an experiment, under different "treatments", or parameter sets. It aids in gathering statistics about what went on in each run, and over the experiment as a whole.

It provides the following:

* Simple python scripting for setting up simulations

* Run simulations under different treatments, and for numbers of replicates

* A plugin framework for gathering information as the simulations run.

* More to come...
